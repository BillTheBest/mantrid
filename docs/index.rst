Documentation
=============

Welcome to the Mantrid documentation. Mantrid is a dynamically-configurable loadbalancer designed for large numbers of distinct hosts; however, it will just as easily serve a site with only one or two hosts.

Key features include the ability to change the configuration on-the-fly via a HTTP API, the ability to temporarily hold connections open while a backend server restarts, configurable matching of subdomains, built-in error pages and redirects, and bandwidth and connection monitoring.
