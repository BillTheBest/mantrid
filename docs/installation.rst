Installation
============

Installing Mantrid is simple; ensure you have a valid installation of `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_, and then just type::

    pip install mantrid

(Most Linux distributions include pip in their package management systems; in Ubuntu and Debian, for example, it is the ``python-pip`` package)

You can also install Mantrid under PyPy 1.7 or greater; this will increase performance. Just use the pypy-specific pip to install it; the ``mantrid`` command may end up being inside your PyPy binary directory.

Once you've installed Mantrid, move on to :doc:`running`.
