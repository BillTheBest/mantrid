Installation
============

If you haven't got `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_ installed, install it from a system package (``python-pip`` on Ubuntu and Debian) or run::

    $ sudo easy_install pip

Then run::

    $ sudo pip install mantrid

You can improve performance by using PyPy 1.7 [#]_ or greater. Just use the pypy-specific pip to install it.

Once you've installed Mantrid, move on to :doc:`running`.


.. [#] At the time of writing, 1.7 is not yet released, but a nightly build will work.
